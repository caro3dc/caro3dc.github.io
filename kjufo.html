        <h1>Second Analysis Home</h1>
        <p>Welcome to this other <i>other</i> section of the website! We, A-10-4 Group 2, present here our analysis on the streaming activity that we did on the 28th of April, 2022.</p><p>Use the sidebar on the left to navigate our site.</p>

        <h1>Stream Summary</h1>
        <p>The stream was an improvised and informal debate ‚Äì much in a similar format to the previous iteration of the stream ‚Äì wherein the hosts asked themselves questions about various topics, such as fruits, career plans, and school experiences, as well as questions that the audience submitted to them.</p><p>The stream attracted a substantial number of viewers, including one teacher.</p>
        </div>

      <div id="up">
        <h1>What Did We Do Well?</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><b><i>What were the things well done during the stream?</i></b></p>
        <p>The <b>audience engagement</b>, the <b>execution</b> of questions and letting the audiences speak out their opinions about the topics being tackled.</p><p>We think it was well done because the audience was interactive and interested enough to acknowledge the activities going on, as well as the answers of us hosts.
</p>
        </div>

      <div id="down">
        <h1>What Did We Not Do Well?</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><b><i>What are the areas of opportunities for the stream?</i></b></p>
        <p>The part that we struggled the most with was the technical difficulties we had to deal with.</p><p>Firstly, we had to <b>delay our stream</b> from <b>23 April to 28 April</b> because of an issue with our streaming software, and secondly, we encountered <b>numerous problems</b> with our individual <b>internet connections</b> even in our final stream on 28 April, which caused some members to not be fully able to participate in the stream.</p><br>

        <h1>What Did We Not Do Well?</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><b><i>What are the areas of opportunities for the stream?</i></b></p>
          <p>It should be noted that these technical problems were <b>also present</b> in the group‚Äôs experience from Quarter 3 ‚Äì however, said problems did not manifest in the form of connectivity issues.</p><p>These connectivity issues likely arose from the physical distance between the group‚Äôs members ‚Äì specifically, with J. Bundoc and C. Del Castillo having moved out from Metro Manila between Quarters 3 and 4, to Nueva Ecija and Baguio, respectively.</p><p>Due to the circumstances of these errors we faced, we don‚Äôt think an immediate solution for these would be available.</p><br>

  <h1>Audience Engagement</h1>
  <p style="text-align: center;"><b><i>What is the level of engagement during the stream?</i></b></p>
  <p>Our audience was, once again, actively engaged ‚Äì according to the statistics, the level of engagement is not that different from last quarter‚Äôs stream.</p><p>Although some of the viewers from the last stream weren't able to join, new viewers were able to come instead. The viewers were actively chatting, and they were even answering our questions to them.</p>

  <h1>Audience Engagement</h1>
  <p style="text-align: center;"><b><i>How did the level of engagement affect the overall performance of the stream?</i></b></p>
  <p>The level of involvement is proportionate to the stream's overall performance. This is because we have observed that the more questions the viewers asked, the more enjoyable it got for both the viewers and the hosts.</p><p>This was also the case during our first stream.</p>

  <p>According to our Twitch statistics, almost no change occurred in our average number of viewers ‚Äì from <b>11</b> in Quarter 3 to <b>12</b> in Quarter 4 <i style="color: var(--iv);">(see image)</i>.</p>

  <h1>Viewership</h1><br>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><b><i>What is your level of viewership?</i></b></p>
    <p>Based on the responses we have for the second stream, some of our viewers lost focus or interest in the podcast due to <b>ongoing schoolwork</b>. Others said one of the hosts was stunning, others were trying to identify someone, and the rest didn't lose interest in the podcast.
  </p>
    <p>Comparing these to the responses from our first stream, some also said that <b>schoolworks were also the cause</b> for them losing interest or focus in the podcast, some said it was because of the sloppy screen that caused distortion, and most of them said they didn't lose any focus or interests in the podcast.</p><p>Therefore, we can say that there were <b>no impactful differences</b> that determined our level of viewership this time around.
