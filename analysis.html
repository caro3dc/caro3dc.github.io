        <h1>Analysis Home</h1>
        <p>Welcome to this other section of the website! We, A-10-4 Group 2, present here our analysis on the streaming activity that we did on the 3rd of March, 2022.</p><p>Use the sidebar on the left to navigate our site.</p>

      <div id="abst">
        <h1>Stream Summary</h1>
        <p>The stream was an informal and improvised podcast, wherein the hosts asked themselves questions about various topics, such as fruits, career plans, personal feelings and experiences, as well as questions that the audience submitted to them.</p><p>The stream attracted a substantial number of viewers, including two teachers.</p>
        </div>

      <div id="up">
        <h1>Things We Did Well</h1>
        <p>The <a style="color: var(--v); font-variation-settings: 'wght' 666;" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VJc7K8CzxFJUoR8MCwT1ch4Rseyb-zM62VSYkiDyqjo/edit?usp=sharing">feedback that we received</a> from our feedback form noted that our podcast was humorous and interesting to watch, and that the topics were handled well. They also noted that the conversations sounded authentic and not scripted.</p><p>This success can be attributed to a lack of commitment to formality, both in the actions and words of the hosts, and in the nature of the questions that were being asked.</p><p> Furthermore, the plans for the podcast stream were intentionally non-solid, so that we, the hosts, could wield creative and conversational liberties than what would be possible in a practiced and scripted stream.</p>
        </div>

      <div id="down">
        <h1>Things We Did Not Do Well</h1>
        <h2>Bad Audio Quality</h2>
        <p>We have agreed among each other that we have to improve the quality of our recording devices, as we faced some technical difficulties (especially regarding our audio quality) during the duration of the stream.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, improving on this requires buying better equipment, which in turn requires spending money that we do not have.<br><br>

        <h2>Unequal Participation</h2>
        <div style="text-align: center;">
          <p>One person from our audience also stated that some hosts were not participating as much as others, and we do agree with them and concede that that is something that needs to be improved upon.</p><p>We think that the reason for why this was the case is partly personality ‚Äì some were less keen to take initiative to answer questions than others ‚Äì and partly because some of the hosts did not call on others as much as some.</p><br>

<div id="auld">
  <h1>Audience Engagement</h1>
  <p>Our audience engagement was on an unexpected level ‚Äì the audience kept on asking questions during the podcast to the point that the hosts could almost not keep up, which helped the event be more lively and interactive.</p><p>According to our internal data, we had <b>36 unique viewers</b> and <b>16 unique chatters</b>, which shows that many of our audience were willing to engage with our stream.</p>

<div id="auld2">
  <h1>Audience Engagement</h1>
  <p>Some of our viewers even had the initiative to directly participate in the conversation, answering in the live chat the questions the hosts were asking themselves.</p><p> At the start of the stream, only some of the audience were able to chat, owing to low initial viewership ‚Äì though as the stream progressed, the audience increased in size, peaking at <b>19 viewers</b> and including two of our teachers.</p><p>As to why this level of engagement was the case, we share sentiments with our viewers, who said in the feedback survey that the topics were handled well, and that our conversations and humour were authentic enough to want to engage with.</p><p>Furthermore, our stream happened one week after the streams of some of the other groups in A-10-4, which meant that more people had the time to join and engage with our stream.</p><br>

  <h1>Viewership</h1><br>

  </div>
  <p>We had an average of 11 viewers and a total of 87 live views <i style="color: var(--iv);">(see image)</i>, which we have concurred is already a lot for a first. We think that the main reason for this is the success of our promotion ‚Äì we sent the link of our stream to our section‚Äôs group chat and to other contacts outside of our section, which resulted in greater exposure.</p><br>

  </div>
    Additionally, the stream was also mentioned by our Lifelabs LF (see image), which we think has helped the advertisability of our stream by at least a small amount.</p>
